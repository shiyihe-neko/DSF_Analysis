Recently I found that google sheets has an option for scripts to be added into the sheet, I used it mostly by asking chatgpt to write code for that but I still learned at least how the code looks and what to expect. This study was a great learning experience and i will try to remember now how to use json. Im unsure about my months of programming since I had around one year of programming in school, but since finnishing it I mostly did stuff throu excel and similiar programs, so I didnt counted that (even if I managed to create entire elo system, was pretty laggy but it worked), with that it would be between 3 to 4 years",one of the tasks felt very tideous until i realised i can select alot of the rows and press tab to move them all at once,High School,"{'JSON': 'Used it a few times', 'JSONC': 'Not familiar at all', 'JSON5': 'Not familiar at all', 'HJSON': 'Not familiar at all', 'YAML': 'Heard of it but never used', 'TOML': 'Not familiar at all', 'XML': 'Comfortable using it'}","['Dysgraphia (e.g., difficulty with handwriting or written expression).']","['No, I do not have any related conditions.']",12.0,Not familiar at all,12.0,1.0
